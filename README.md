# GraspEase

An Indigenous, Low-Cost Active Wrist–Hand Orthosis for Rehabilitation

**Affordable Wrist–Hand Orthosis for Functional Grasp + Rehab**

---

## Branches of this repository:

1. **main** – contains the Arduino IDE codes for the functioning of the ESP32 dev boards.  
2. **android-app** – contains the Android dev files for the GraspEase App and the apk  
   (path: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug_21_final.apk` in the android-app branch).  
3. **rehab-game** – contains the script for gamified rehabilitation `mult.py` and its  
   `requirements.txt` file.

## Overview

This project aims to develop an affordable, user-centric wrist–hand orthosis that helps users restore functional grasp, hold, and release while also promoting rehabilitation and independence. The solution is designed to be accessible, scalable, and cost-effective—positioning it as an alternative to high-cost robotic rehabilitation systems.

---

## Key Goals

- Enable functional hand actions: *grasp → hold → release*  
- Support rehabilitation through structured therapy and progress tracking  
- Provide multi-modal control so users with different mobility levels can operate the device comfortably  
- Deliver a user-friendly app experience  
- Improve accessibility using hands-free interaction where needed  

---

## Multi-Control Access

To accommodate users with varying motor abilities, the orthosis supports multiple control inputs:

- **Switch control**  
- **Joystick control**  
- **Tilt/IMU-based control**  
- **Foot pedal control**  
- **App-based control**  

This approach ensures the system can be configured for individual needs, improving usability and independence.

---

## Application Layer (Android + Google Technologies)

The system includes an Android-based application, designed to be intuitive for daily use while supporting rehabilitation workflows.

---

## Speech-to-Text (Hands-Free Control)

The system integrates Speech-to-Text functionality to allow hands-free control, especially beneficial for users with severe motor limitations. This reduces reliance on physical inputs and improves overall accessibility.

---

## Rehabilitation + Therapy Modes

To encourage consistent use and measurable recovery, the orthosis includes:

- **Rehabilitation modes** for guided training  
- **Gamified therapy modes** to improve engagement, motivation, and adherence  

These modes are designed to make therapy more interactive while supporting long-term improvement.

---

## Why This Matters

Many existing robotic rehabilitation systems are effective but often expensive and inaccessible. This project focuses on delivering a solution that is:

- **Affordable**  
- **User-centric**  
- **Intelligent**  
- **Accessible**  
- **Rehab-oriented**  
- **Scalable for broader adoption**
